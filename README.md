# 📺 Netflix Shows Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains my **third Power BI project**, where I analyzed a Netflix Shows Dataset to uncover insights about the type of content, genres, release trends, featured directors, and more.

The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**, and I used Power BI to transform the data, create visualizations, and build an interactive dashboard. This project helped me dive deeper into **Power Query**, grouping and aggregation techniques, and effective storytelling using visual analytics.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- ✅ Transformed and cleaned raw Netflix data using **Power Query Editor**
- ✅ Created queries using **Group By** operations for director, genre, type, etc.
- ✅ Built an interactive dashboard using **Bar Charts, Pie Charts, and KPI Cards**
- ✅ Analyzed **type distribution (TV Shows vs. Movies)**, **popular genres**, and **most featured directors**
- ✅ Analyzed **most available shows as per the season and duration.
- ✅ Bar Chart showing count of shows as per the rating of movies.
- ✅ Analyzing countris of production through Map.
